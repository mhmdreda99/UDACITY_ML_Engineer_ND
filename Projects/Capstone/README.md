# Dog Breed Classifier 
## Project overview
The primary goal of this project is to do the following tasks using CNN:
* Given an image of the dog, the model should predict its breed
* If human is detected in image, the model should predict
resembling dog breed

## Prerequisites

* Anaconda 
* [PyTorch](https://https://pytorch.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [TQDM](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
* [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

<h2>Datasets</h2>
To run the dog app you need to download the following images of dogs and humans:

* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).
  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the
  location `/data/dog_images`.

* Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).
  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/data/lfw`.
